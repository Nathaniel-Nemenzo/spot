better implementations:
1. Get all of the authorities from the directory client using one call (listservices).
    - put into map where we have [name, authority]
2. flesh out thread classes / make sure we have way to stop them without killing program


refactors:
1. Refactor into library structure according to service structure on Spot
    - Namespaces
    - Layers (https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/readme)
    - Core functions (per link above)
2. Flesh out methods (optimizations and handling of more cases)
3. Finish error handling and try to handle all user cases
4. Rewrite robot class using above
5. Figure out how to create a shared library with CMake
6. ???
7. profit
